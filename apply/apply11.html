	<p>To build a good credit score the first step is to make sure your bills are 
		paid on time. This is a big factor in your credit score because it shows
		good future performance. Another big help is paying off debt and keeping
		the balance on credit cards low. The last major factor in keeping or gaining
		a good credit score is to dispute any and all inaccuacies on your credit
		reports. If inaccuacies are left alone they will cause your credit score to 
		drop for reasons that are not your fault.</p>
		
	<ul>
		<li>Don't close unused credit cards</li>
		<li>Keep your debt low</li>
		<li>Don't apply for too much new credit</li>
	</ul>
